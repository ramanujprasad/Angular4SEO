# Angular 4 SEO Demo App

## Making your angular app SEO friendly?
By default, Angular apps are not search engine friendly. If you view the page source in a browser of a regular Angular app, it will only show what's inside the regular index.html -- the infamous loading.. content. To fix this, we need the app to be rendered on a server and then displayed to the client. This way, your content for each page (each component) is spit out for the browser and that lovely Googlebot to see.

```bash

# clone the repo
$ git clone https://github.com/ramanujprasad/Angular4SEO.git

# change directory to our repo
cd Angular4SEO

# install dependencies for the project with npm
`npm install`

# start the server (Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`)
`npm run start`

```

## How does it looks like?
